# IoT Data Visualization
This project is a demonstration of the display of CSV data, using the [**plotly Dash**](https://dash.plot.ly/) environment.

The python code here generates a [hosted Dash page](https://dash-steve.herokuapp.com/). On that page you can select and submit two dates.  A graph will be generated which shows rainfall at two different locations:
* [MƒÅkara coast](https://goo.gl/maps/1kAxRc6TprDhdcJL78)
* [Zealandia Eco Sanctuary](https://goo.gl/maps/Q3yAA8ToBegKZzhY8)

You can mouse over the graph to get details of each point, and have options for further processing the data, using Plotly tools (top right of graph).
[Here is an example of page use.](https://github.com/SteveCossy/IOT/blob/master/visualisation/2020-02-25.png)
