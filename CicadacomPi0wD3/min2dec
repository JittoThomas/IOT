This is the function I wrote that converts degree:minutes to degree.decimal
Have taken it out of the code following our discussion deciding to put this conversion in before sending data to Cayenne.

import time

def min2dec (RefMinutes):
	     # Accept a geolocation element (longitude or latitude) in degrees.Minutes (String or float)
	     # Return a string representing the same element in degrees with decimals
	     RefMinutes = float(RefMinutes) # ensure RefMinutes is a float
	     WholeNbr = math.trunc(RefMinutes) # get the whole degrees number ...
	     result = RefMinutes - WholeNbr # ... and remove it for now
	     result = (result / 60 * 100) + WholeNbr  # convert minutes to decimals of degrees and add back degrees
	     return str(result)

Was called at lines 86 and 87

           Location['LAT'] = min2dec (Location['LAT'])
           Location['LONG'] = min2dec (Location['LONG'])
