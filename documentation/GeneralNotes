Future work
  - add data checking
    - pass PicAxe checksum, and check against it again.
    - other stuff?

Picaxe Programming
 - serial programming leage
 - Get serial from PA - Sensor A = Channel 1, B = 2 etc
 - 1 = temp, 2 = time (uptime to 250), 3 = random
 - TTL data - white = Pin 10 of GPIO
 - Black and red = Pin 2 +ve (near corner) Pin 6 ground
 Pinouts: http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Raspberry-Pi-GPIO-Layout-Model-B-Plus-rotated-2700x900.png
 
- pin protocols
  - defined as required
    - ttl = 3.3 volt ttl logic, 2400 baud
    - spi, i squared C, 
    - Pi Zero = more flexable
